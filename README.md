# InternetRadioPlayer
Android application for playing internet radio streams primarily targeted for automotive head units.

Some time ago my FM radio tuner in my Android car head unit went bad, so I built a simple app for playing radio streams over the internet as a replacement. Recently, I have decided to resurrect that app and publish it here on GitHub. It is built using Jetpack Compose with MVI pattern.

:warning: This project is in development and there might be some nice-to-have features missing.
